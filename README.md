# Merchandise-Analytics-PYthon

Problem Statement - Retailers struggle to manage merchandise effectively across digital and physical channels due to demand uncertainty, inventory inefficiencies, pricing complexity, and the need for personalized customer experiences.

Data Information -The dataset covers transaction details, product info, sales metrics, customer engagement, and geographic/seasonal trendsâ€”enabling analysis of buying patterns, pricing, promotions, satisfaction, and regional-seasonal performance.

Solution - Align pricing, promotions, and inventory based on product seasonality, category, and market trends. Focus region-specific marketing on South and optimize inventory and campaigns for West to boost sales. Increase discounts and offers strategically for medium/low seasonality products and slow market periods, especially for items browsed over 8 seconds or purchased in higher quantities. Improve product descriptions and visuals to increase customer engagement and reduce short browsing times. Optimize promotions during key time frames, including 9-11 AM dips and peak browsing windows (3-5 and 6-8 seconds).
